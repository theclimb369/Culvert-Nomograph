# Culvert-Nomograph
This project includes the codes and principles behind four types of Culvert nomograph
1. Mannings - Flow, Hydraulic grade, Diameter/Velocity 
2. Colebrook White - Flow, Hydraulic grade (Slope), Diameter/Velocity 
3. Inlet Submerged - Diameter - D(m), Flow - Q(m^3/s), Headwater depth HW/D for three circular pipes
4. Outlet Submerged - Flow - Q(m^3/s), Diameter - D(m), Pipe length - L(m), Heahwater Loss - H(m) 
Detail notes behind can be referred to File - Principles.pdf
